# Non-Functional Requirements

## 1. Performance
- The system should respond to user actions (e.g., task creation, update, delete) within 1 second under normal load.
- The API should handle at least 100 concurrent users without significant degradation in response time.
- Database queries should be optimized to minimize latency and avoid unnecessary data retrieval.

## 2. Security
- All sensitive data (e.g., passwords, tokens) must be encrypted in transit and at rest.
- The system must implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
- The application must be protected against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).
- User sessions must expire after a period of inactivity (e.g., 30 minutes).

## 3. Scalability
- The system should be designed to support horizontal scaling (e.g., load balancing, stateless API servers).
- The database should be able to handle growth in the number of users and tasks without performance loss.
- The architecture should allow for easy addition of new features and integration with third-party services.

## 4. Usability
- The user interface should be intuitive and accessible to users of varying technical backgrounds.
- The application should follow accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) to support users with disabilities.
- Error messages should be clear, actionable, and user-friendly.
- The system should provide responsive design for use on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## 5. Reliability & Availability
- The system should have an uptime of at least 99.5%.
- Regular backups of the database must be performed to prevent data loss.
- The system should provide meaningful error handling and logging for troubleshooting.
